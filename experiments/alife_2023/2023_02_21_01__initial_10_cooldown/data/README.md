- `./processed_data/` - Contains processed data for the initial 200 parallel replicates
- `./reps/` - Data of the four main replicates analyzed in the paper, both raw (where feasible) and processed. 
- `./scripts/` - Contains R and Python scrips to pull/analyze/aggregate data from the scratch space to here. 
- `./combined_final_dominant_data.csv` - Data for the dominant genotype (most abundant in extant population at end of evolution) for all 200 initial replicates
- `./combined_final_max_data.csv` - Data for best-performing organism at the end of evolution for all 200 initial replicates.
- `./combined_final_phylogenetic_data.csv` - Phylogenetic summary statistics from the end of evolution in each of the 200 initial replicates. 
- `./learning_summary_data.csv` - Summary data for _all_ learning replicates from the initial 200 parallel replicates. 
- `./lineage_data.tar.gz` - Archive of the dominant lineage for all 200 initial replicates. 
- `./rep_data.tar.gz` - Archive that includes a final dominant summary (in the format of `combined_final_dominant_data.csv`) for the replays (exploratory and targetted) of the main four lineages (and four exploratory-only replays for four more learning lineages).
