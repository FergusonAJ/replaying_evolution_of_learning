Each folder contains images depicting how organisms handled their 100 trials. 
One folder exists for each behavior that was detected, and each folder contains _all_ seeds in that category. 

For the individual images, each trial is a line that is four blocks tall. Trials are separated by a little bit of space. 
In an individual trace, each column represents one state transition by the organism. 
The correct state is shown with the small yellow square. 
The organisms action is shown with a larger green (if correct) or red (if incorrect) square. 
Then the next state is shown in the next column. 

Note we've had two name changes. `bet_hedged_imprinting` is the same as "bet-hedged learning" in the paper, while `small` is the same as "low activity".
