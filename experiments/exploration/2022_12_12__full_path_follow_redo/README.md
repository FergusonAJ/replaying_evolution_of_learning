# 2022 11 13 - Fixed start with exponential merit (base 2)

### Reason to run

Little to nothing evolved when we switched to using exponential fitness in the purely random 3c1s environment. 
Before diving deeper into those more difficult environments, let's take a step back and see what evolves when the envioronment is much more predictable.
If nothing evolves in this environment, there is no chance anything would evolve in the much harder random environment. 


### Results

All replicates failed to evolve complex behavior. All replicates were classified as "small" as they typically took fewer than 10 correct doors.
